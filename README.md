##Project Overview:

This desktop application is designed to manage driver and vehicle licensing operations. It streamlines tasks such as license issuance, renewal, and suspension, aiming to reduce manual effort and improve efficiency within licensing departments.

###Technologies Used:

- C# (Windows Forms) for application development.
- SQL Server as the database.
- ADO.NET for database connectivity and operations.
- 3-Tier Architecture (Presentation, Business Logic, Data Access).
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

###Features:

- Issue new driver and vehicle licenses.
- Renew existing licenses.
- Suspend licenses when required.
- Manage and store driver and vehicle records securely in SQL Server.
- Clean separation of concerns through layered architecture for scalability and maintainability.

###Project Structure:

- Presentation Layer → User Interface built with Windows Forms.
- Business Layer → Handles application logic and rules.
- Data Access Layer (DAL) → Interacts with SQL Server database using ADO.NET.

###Key Benefits:

- Improves efficiency of licensing operations.
- Reduces reliance on manual processes.
- Easy to maintain and extend thanks to clean architecture.

###Future Enhancements:

- web-based application
